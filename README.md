# Overview

This is a side project to generate various fretboard and fretboard diagrams that I'm using to learn guitar.

This isn't intended to be useful to anyone but me in its current form, but it's slowly evolving towards a library of reusable functions since I like to code that way.

Shoot me a note if you use this or would like to, and I'll use that to guide what to make or keep stable.


# Installation

To install `node-canvas` on Mac, I needed the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` setting below.
Note that `cairo.pc` is also present in `/usr/local/Cellar/cairo/1.12.14/lib/pkgconfig/cairo`; setting `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to this directory did *not* work for me.
Given this, I don't know whether `brew install cairo` is actually necessary.

    brew install node cairo
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig npm install


# Usage

    coffee intervals.coffee chordbook

Create a PDF that shows the easiest fingering for each chord.

    coffee intervals.coffee chordbook --combined

Create a PDF that shows all the fretboard positions that corresponds to the notes for each chord.
This can be used to select from among multiple fingerings; also to see how the chord shapes relate to each other.

    coffee intervals.coffee intervals

Create a PDF that displays all the interval classes from each
fretboard position.

    coffee intervals.coffee animation

Create a flipbook that shows how the different chord shapes relate to each other.
This is very much in progress.
