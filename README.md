# Overview

This is a side project to generate various fretboard and fretboard diagrams that I'm using to learn guitar.

This isn't intended to be useful to anyone but me in its current form, but it's slowly evolving towards a library of reusable functions since I like to code that way.

Shoot me a note if you use this or would like to, and I'll use that to guide what to make or keep stable.
